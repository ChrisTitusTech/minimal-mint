# Linux Mint mini

run the `mini.sh` to purge Linux Mint from software that you likely don't need or use. 

After running bash script on a new Linux Mint install there is _1971_ software packages installed `apt list --installed | wc -l`

- i also added `sudo rm -r /etc/libreoffice/registry/res  \` as it was not removed due to not being empty

_a minimal Linux_
